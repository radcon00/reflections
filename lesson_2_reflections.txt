What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file is added to the directory that is used to keep tracjk of the changes that are made to the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle man between the repository and the working directory. It is used a location to put the files that you would
like to commit so they can all be committed at the same time. 

it gives you a nice level of control over what files are committed once a commit is done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? That is easy. The staging area can be used to veiw the changes in the files vs the logical directory. You can confirm if the changes warrant a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? how would branches help?

Branches would make it easier for me when i wanted to test some new functionality in my code base but do not want it added to the master branch. Branches creates a completely sepearate code base that you can use as your playground.
