What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file is added to the directory that is used to keep tracjk of the changes that are made to the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle man between the repository and the working directory. It is used a location to put the files that you would
like to commit so they can all be committed at the same time. 

it gives you a nice level of control over what files are committed once a commit is done.
