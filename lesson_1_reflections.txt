How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
good
It made it easier to spot the differences in the files. 
I an see where this would be a very useful tool.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficent
programmer in the long term?

With access to the entire history, i could easier track down bugs that suddenly
started appearing in my app at a particular time. Using it to look back and compare
old code that was working fine with the new errored code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

I think that it gives you flexibility to chose when your commits take place and it will limit the size of the commits.
But on the flipside, you are liable to forget a commit from time to time, since it would be a manual process.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log provides an overview of the commit history of the repository. A log of with a breif description of what has been changed. 
The git diff command gives you a more detailed view of the actual changes that were made between two commits. I shows what lines where added/removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
there would be less concern for breaking something because i could just roll it back. It would be a piece of cake for me. The only concern that i would have is that i would need to know the id number of the most receint commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would try to use git to manage the version of you resumebuilder code base
